# Tinnies

**Development note:** Pausing this version (with React) to work on a simpler non-React frontend so I can get a functional prototype. I will return to the react version in the future.

A helpful tool to track ya tinnies.

## Pain point

You're driving home on a Friday after a hard week of work. You're about to go past the last bottleo and can't remember if you have any tinnies in the shed fridge. What do you do?

Drive past and risk running out? Yeah, nah.

**You check Tinnies.**

Tinnies quickly tells you how many cans are in the fridge. Six left!? Yeah mate, you'll need to grab a slab (or two -- aren't the boys coming around tonight after Wayne finshes building his deck?).
